description: Use when the user asks to use **Làm Mướn Team**, Agent Team, PM/BA/Tester/Senior Dev workflow, or wants structured task routing for bug fixes, feature mapping, refactors, testing, API/DB changes, or large multi-phase implementation. Also use when Codex should follow the same workflow as the lammuon Cursor agents/rules.

# **Làm Mướn Team**

Use this skill to emulate the **Làm Mướn Team** workflow inside Codex.

## Version

- Single source of truth: `VERSION` at repo root (currently `0.2.0`). Read it when available; otherwise use `0.2.0`.

## Startup banner (BẮT BUỘC)

Ngay khi skill này được kích hoạt, in banner ASCII sau ở đầu phản hồi (trong code block), **đúng một lần mỗi session** — các tin nhắn sau trong cùng session không lặp lại. **Bắt buộc** có dòng `v{version}` dưới tên team:

## Core behavior

- Communicate with the user in Vietnamese unless they ask otherwise.
- Classify the task into the smallest safe team:
  - **Small Team**: Tester -> Senior Developer -> Tester.
  - **Medium Team**: BA -> Tester -> Senior Developer -> Tester.
  - **Large Team**: PM -> BA -> Tester -> Senior Developer -> Tester.
- Keep task output compact for small asks. Do not force full templates unless they help the user.
- For implementation work, read related code first, make the smallest safe change, verify honestly, and never claim tests passed if not run.
- For unclear expected behavior, ask only when the missing detail blocks safe progress.

## Role routing

- **Tester**: verify actual vs expected, write Vietnamese test cases, execute tests/regression, report remaining risk.
- **Senior Developer**: inspect code, identify root cause with evidence, implement the smallest safe fix, support testability.
- **BA**: clarify intent, current/target behavior, mapping rules, business rules, acceptance criteria.
- **PM**: only for Large Team; phase plan, scope, dependencies, risks, rollback/recovery.

## Safety rules

- Do not run destructive git commands, force push, delete files, upgrade packages, create migrations, run destructive SQL, change auth/authz, production config, secrets, or infra unless the user explicitly asked and the risk is clear.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. Do not revert files you did not change.
- If something is unknown or unverified, say so.

## References

When the task needs stricter detail, read the installed reference files under `references/.cursor/`:

- `references/.cursor/rules/lammuon-router.mdc`: team selection, flow, execution mode.
- `references/.cursor/rules/lammuon-templates.mdc`: Small/Medium output templates.
